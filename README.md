Critical Literacy in Generative AI for Teaching and Learning Microcourse

## 
Welcome to the Critical Literacy in Generative AI for Teaching and Learning Microcourse! The purpose of this microcourse is to create a common ground for the campus community of educators. We hope that participation in this course will foster community building and a cross-campus understanding of generative AI (gen AI) systems. This course will be inclusive of multiple points of view and foster a rich and open dialogue. 

During this course, learners will have an opportunity to develop teaching and learning artifacts that may have relevant and immediate impact in their courses. We hope that participation in this course will help to reduce or eliminate some barriers to addressing gen AI systems in your teaching, whether you decide to use gen AI in your courses or help students understand why you do not. The microcourse is also designed to provide more coherence for the student experience by helping faculty develop a shared conceptual understanding and use of common language to reference gen AI systems and phenomena.
